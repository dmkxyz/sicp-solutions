# SICP Solutions  

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**. Working through this book has rekindled my appreciation for the fundamentals of programming and software design.  

## Structure  
- Solutions are organized by chapter.  
- Written in Scheme, compatible with MIT/GNU Scheme and Racket.  

## Usage  
Clone the repo and run with a Scheme interpreter. Works best using #sicp in Racket.
